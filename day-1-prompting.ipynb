    "# Day 1 - Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show you how to get started with the Gemini API and walk you through some of the example prompts and techniques that you can also read about in the Prompting whitepaper. You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll start exploring prompting using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n",
    "* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n",
    "* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## For help\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n",
    "\n",
    "## New for Gemini 2.0!\n",
    "\n",
    "This course material was first launched in November 2024. The AI and LLM space is moving incredibly fast, so we have made some updates to use the latest models and capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "* These codelabs have been updated to use the Gemini 2.0 family of models.\n",
    "* The Python SDK has been updated from `google-generativeai` to the new, unified [`google-genai`](https://pypi.org/project/google-genai) SDK.\n",
    "  * This new SDK works with both the developer Gemini API as well as Google Cloud Vertex AI, and switching is [as simple as changing some fields](https://pypi.org/project/google-genai/#:~:text=.Client%28%29-,API%20Selection,-By%20default%2C%20the).\n",
    "* New model capabilities have been added to the relevant codelabs, such as \"thinking mode\" in this lab.\n",
    "* Day 1 includes a new [Evaluation codelab](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-evaluation-and-structured-output)."

It allows language models to access and incorporate external knowledge sources, leading to more accurate, informative, and contextually relevant responses. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved in implementing RAG:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Data Preparation and Indexing:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Gather Data:**\n",
      "    *   **Identify Relevant Knowledge Sources:** Determine the knowledge domains relevant to your application (e.g., documentation, knowledge bases, web pages, research papers).\n",
      "    *   **Extract Data:**  Extract the information from these sources. This might involve:\n",
      "        *   Web scraping for online content.\n",
      "        *   Reading files (PDFs, TXT, DOCX, etc.).\n",
      "        *   Querying databases.\n",
      "        *   Using APIs to access structured data.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Chunking:**\n",
      "    *   **Divide Data into Manageable Chunks:** Break down the extracted data into smaller, meaningful segments.  Careful chunking is *crucial* for retrieval performance.  Consider these factors:\n",
      "        *   **Chunk Size:** Smaller chunks capture more granular details but can lose context. Larger chunks retain context but may retrieve irrelevant information.  Experiment to find the optimal size for your data and use case.  Common sizes are around 100-500 tokens.\n",
      "        *   **Chunking Strategies:**\n",
      "            *   **Fixed-Size Chunking:** Simple, but may split sentences or paragraphs awkwardly.\n",
      "            *   **Semantic Chunking:** Uses sentence segmentation or other NLP techniques to ensure chunks are semantically coherent.\n",
      "            *   **Recursive Chunking:** Divides text recursively based on headings, paragraphs, and sentences. This is often a very good strategy for retaining hierarchies.\n",
      "            *   **Overlapping Chunks:** Include some overlap between chunks to maintain continuity, especially when using smaller chunks.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Embeddings:**\n",
      "    *   **Create Vector Embeddings:**  Convert each chunk into a vector representation using a suitable embedding model (e.g., Sentence Transformers, OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002`, or other pre-trained or fine-tuned models).  The embedding model should be chosen based on the characteristics of your data and the type of queries you expect.\n",
      "    *   **Embedding Quality:** The quality of your embeddings directly impacts retrieval accuracy.  Choose a model trained on data similar to your knowledge base and consider fine-tuning it.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Indexing:**\n",
      "    *   **Store Embeddings in a Vector Database (Vector Store):**  Use a vector database to efficiently store and index the generated embeddings.  Popular options include:\n",
      "        *   **Pinecone:** Scalable and performant cloud-based vector database.\n",
      "        *   **Weaviate:** Open-source vector search engine with graph capabilities.\n",
      "        *   **ChromaDB:** Open-source embedding database.\n",
      "        *   **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search):**  Library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.\n",
      "        *   **Milvus:** Open-source vector database built for AI applications.\n",
      "    *   **Populate the Vector Database:** Load the embeddings and corresponding text chunks into the vector database. Configure the database for efficient similarity search.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Query and Retrieval:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Formulate Query:**  The user inputs a question or query.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Embed Query:** Convert the user's query into a vector embedding using the *same embedding model* used to embed the data chunks.  This consistency is vital for accurate similarity search.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Similarity Search:**  Perform a similarity search in the vector database to find the chunks whose embeddings are most similar to the query embedding. The vector database uses similarity metrics like cosine similarity or dot product to identify the top `k` most relevant chunks.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Retrieve Relevant Chunks:**  Retrieve the top `k` chunks of text and their corresponding metadata (e.g., source document, title) from the vector database.  The value of `k` is a hyperparameter that you can tune. A higher `k` might retrieve more relevant information but can also introduce irrelevant information.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Generation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Context Augmentation:** Combine the retrieved chunks with the original query to create a context-augmented prompt.  This is the *core* of the RAG process.  The goal is to provide the language model with the relevant knowledge it needs to generate a high-quality response. Common approaches include:\n",
      "    *   **Simple Concatenation:**  Simply concatenate the retrieved chunks with the query.\n",
      "    *   **Prompt Engineering:** Craft a more sophisticated prompt that explicitly instructs the language model to use the retrieved information to answer the query.  For example:\n",
      "        *   \"Answer the following question based on the context provided. Question: {query} Context: {retrieved_chunks}\"\n",
      "        *   \"Use the following information to answer the question: {query}. Information: {retrieved_chunks}\"\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Generate Response:**  Feed the context-augmented prompt to a large language model (LLM) like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama 2, PaLM 2, or others.  The LLM uses its pre-trained knowledge and the provided context to generate a response to the query.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Response Refinement (Optional):**  Optionally, refine the generated response using techniques like:\n",
      "    *   **Post-processing:** Correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors.\n",
      "    *   **Filtering:**  Remove irrelevant or redundant information.\n",
      "    *   **Summarization:** Condense the response for brevity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Evaluation and Iteration:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Evaluate Performance:**  Evaluate the quality of the RAG system's responses using metrics such as:\n",
      "    *   **Relevance:** How well the response addresses the query.\n",
      "    *   **Accuracy:** How factually correct the response is.\n",
      "    *   **Coherence:** How well the response is written and organized.\n",
      "    *   **Groundedness:** How well the response is supported by the retrieved context.\n",
      "    *   **Hallucination:** Assessing if the LLM is making up facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Iterate and Refine:** Based on the evaluation results, iterate on the following aspects of the RAG system:\n",
      "    *   **Chunking Strategy:** Adjust chunk size and chunking method.\n",
      "    *   **Embedding Model:** Experiment with different embedding models or fine-tune the existing model.\n",
      "    *   **Vector Database:** Explore different vector databases and indexing techniques.\n",
      "    *   **Retrieval Strategy:** Adjust the value of `k` (number of retrieved chunks).\n",
      "    *   **Prompt Engineering:** Refine the prompt to better guide the LLM.\n",
      "    *   **LLM:** Experiment with different LLMs or fine-tune the chosen LLM.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Considerations and Best Practices:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Prompt Engineering is Critical:**  The prompt is the interface between the retrieved context and the language model. Well-crafted prompts can significantly improve the quality of the generated responses.\n",
      "*   **Context Window Limits:**  Language models have a limited context window (the amount of text they can process at once).  Ensure that the combined length of the query and retrieved chunks does not exceed the LLM's context window.  Consider techniques like truncation or summarization if necessary.\n",
      "*   **Data Quality Matters:**  The quality of the data used to build the knowledge base directly impacts the performance of the RAG system.  Clean and accurate data is essential.\n",
      "*   **Trade-offs Between Retrieval and Generation:**  RAG balances the benefits of retrieval and generation.  Retrieval provides factual grounding, while generation provides fluency and expressiveness.  Finding the right balance is crucial for achieving optimal performance.\n",
      "*   **Metadata Management:** Include relevant metadata (source document, timestamps, etc.) with each chunk. This metadata can be used for filtering and improving the retrieval process.\n",
      "*   **Hybrid Retrieval Methods:** Consider combining vector search with other retrieval methods, such as keyword search or semantic search, to improve accuracy.\n",
      "*   **Continuous Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the performance of the RAG system and retrain or update the knowledge base as needed.\n",
      "*   **Experimentation is Key:** RAG is a highly adaptable technique. Don't be afraid to experiment with different approaches to find the best configuration for your specific use case.\n",
      "*   **Security:** Be aware of potential security vulnerabilities, such as prompt injection attacks, and implement appropriate security measures. Validate and sanitize user inputs and consider implementing guardrails to prevent the LLM from generating harmful or inappropriate content.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these steps and continuously refining your approach, you can build a powerful and effective RAG system that leverages external knowledge to generate high-quality responses. Remember that the optimal configuration will depend on your specific data, use case, and the capabilities of the chosen LLM.\n",

      "*   **Error Messages:** Any error messages encountered during the conversation.\n",
      "*   **API Calls & Results:** If the chatbot interacts with external APIs, store the API requests and responses.\n",
      "*   **Assigned Agent (if applicable):** If a human agent takes over the conversation, record the agent's ID.\n",
      "*   **Conversation Resolution:**  How the conversation ended (e.g., \"successfully completed task,\" \"user abandoned,\" \"transferred to agent\").\n",
      "*   **User satisfaction:** A metric indicating the user's satisfaction with the conversation (e.g., a rating scale, sentiment analysis of their messages).\n",

      "*   **Task Completion Rate:** The percentage of conversations that successfully complete a desired task.\n",
      "*   **Fallback Rate:** The percentage of times the chatbot fails to understand the user's intent and resorts to a fallback response.  High fallback rates indicate areas for improvement.\n",
      "*   **Containment Rate:** The percentage of conversations that are resolved without human intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Database Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Database Type:** Choose a database that is suitable for storing large volumes of text data and supporting complex queries.  Popular options include:\n",

       "*   **Embed Query:** Convert the user's query into a vector embedding using the *same embedding model* used to embed the data chunks.  This consistency is vital for accurate similarity search.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Similarity Search:**  Perform a similarity search in the vector database to find the chunks whose embeddings are most similar to the query embedding. The vector database uses similarity metrics like cosine similarity or dot product to identify the top `k` most relevant chunks.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Retrieve Relevant Chunks:**  Retrieve the top `k` chunks of text and their corresponding metadata (e.g., source document, title) from the vector database.  The value of `k` is a hyperparameter that you can tune. A higher `k` might retrieve more relevant information but can also introduce irrelevant information.\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. Generation:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Context Augmentation:** Combine the retrieved chunks with the original query to create a context-augmented prompt.  This is the *core* of the RAG process.  The goal is to provide the language model with the relevant knowledge it needs to generate a high-quality response. Common approaches include:\n",
       "    *   **Simple Concatenation:**  Simply concatenate the retrieved chunks with the query.\n",
       "    *   **Prompt Engineering:** Craft a more sophisticated prompt that explicitly instructs the language model to use the retrieved information to answer the query.  For example:\n",
       "        *   \"Answer the following question based on the context provided. Question: {query} Context: {retrieved_chunks}\"\n",
       "        *   \"Use the following information to answer the question: {query}. Information: {retrieved_chunks}\"\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Generate Response:**  Feed the context-augmented prompt to a large language model (LLM) like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama 2, PaLM 2, or others.  The LLM uses its pre-trained knowledge and the provided context to generate a response to the query.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Response Refinement (Optional):**  Optionally, refine the generated response using techniques like:\n",
       "    *   **Post-processing:** Correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors.\n",
       "    *   **Filtering:**  Remove irrelevant or redundant information.\n",
       "    *   **Summarization:** Condense the response for brevity.\n",
       "\n",
       "**4. Evaluation and Iteration:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Evaluate Performance:**  Evaluate the quality of the RAG system's responses using metrics such as:\n",
       "    *   **Relevance:** How well the response addresses the query.\n",
       "    *   **Accuracy:** How factually correct the response is.\n",
       "    *   **Coherence:** How well the response is written and organized.\n",
       "    *   **Groundedness:** How well the response is supported by the retrieved context.\n",
       "    *   **Hallucination:** Assessing if the LLM is making up facts.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Iterate and Refine:** Based on the evaluation results, iterate on the following aspects of the RAG system:\n",
       "    *   **Chunking Strategy:** Adjust chunk size and chunking method.\n",
       "    *   **Embedding Model:** Experiment with different embedding models or fine-tune the existing model.\n",
       "    *   **Vector Database:** Explore different vector databases and indexing techniques.\n",
       "    *   **Retrieval Strategy:** Adjust the value of `k` (number of retrieved chunks).\n",
       "    *   **Prompt Engineering:** Refine the prompt to better guide the LLM.\n",
       "    *   **LLM:** Experiment with different LLMs or fine-tune the chosen LLM.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Considerations and Best Practices:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Prompt Engineering is Critical:**  The prompt is the interface between the retrieved context and the language model. Well-crafted prompts can significantly improve the quality of the generated responses.\n",
       "*   **Context Window Limits:**  Language models have a limited context window (the amount of text they can process at once).  Ensure that the combined length of the query and retrieved chunks does not exceed the LLM's context window.  Consider techniques like truncation or summarization if necessary.\n",
       "*   **Data Quality Matters:**  The quality of the data used to build the knowledge base directly impacts the performance of the RAG system.  Clean and accurate data is essential.\n",
       "*   **Trade-offs Between Retrieval and Generation:**  RAG balances the benefits of retrieval and generation.  Retrieval provides factual grounding, while generation provides fluency and expressiveness.  Finding the right balance is crucial for achieving optimal performance.\n",
       "*   **Metadata Management:** Include relevant metadata (source document, timestamps, etc.) with each chunk. This metadata can be used for filtering and improving the retrieval process.\n",
       "*   **Hybrid Retrieval Methods:** Consider combining vector search with other retrieval methods, such as keyword search or semantic search, to improve accuracy.\n",
       "*   **Continuous Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the performance of the RAG system and retrain or update the knowledge base as needed.\n",
       "*   **Experimentation is Key:** RAG is a highly adaptable technique. Don't be afraid to experiment with different approaches to find the best configuration for your specific use case.\n",
       "*   **Security:** Be aware of potential security vulnerabilities, such as prompt injection attacks, and implement appropriate security measures. Validate and sanitize user inputs and consider implementing guardrails to prevent the LLM from generating harmful or inappropriate content.\n",
       "\n",
       "By following these steps and continuously refining your approach, you can build a powerful and effective RAG system that leverages external knowledge to generate high-quality responses. Remember that the optimal configuration will depend on your specific data, use case, and the capabilities of the chosen LLM.\n"

       "*   **Data Collection:** Gather the knowledge base you want your chatbot to access. This could be documents, articles, FAQs, code snippets, or any other relevant text data.\n",
       "*   **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Clean the data to remove irrelevant information (e.g., HTML tags, special characters). You might also need to split large documents into smaller chunks to improve retrieval accuracy. Techniques include sentence splitting or fixed-size chunking.\n",
       "*   **Embedding Generation:** Use BERT (or a similar transformer model) to create embeddings (vector representations) of your text chunks. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text.  You can use a pre-trained BERT model (e.g., `bert-base-uncased`, `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` for better sentence embeddings) or fine-tune one on your specific data if you have enough training examples.\n",

       "    *   **Embedding Generation (Query):**  Use the same BERT model you used for your knowledge base to create an embedding of the user's query. This ensures compatibility when searching the vector database.\n",
       "*   **Retrieval:**\n",
       "    *   **Similarity Search:**  Use the query embedding to perform a similarity search in your vector database.  This retrieves the *k* most relevant text chunks from your knowledge base (where *k* is a hyperparameter you can tune). Common similarity metrics include cosine similarity and dot product.\n",
       "*   **Augmentation (RAG):**\n",
       "    *   **Contextualization:** Combine the retrieved text chunks with the user's query.  This creates a context-rich input for the BERT model.  You can do this by:\n",
       "        *   **Concatenation:** Simply concatenate the query and the retrieved documents (with separators like `[SEP]` or `\\n\\n`).\n",
       "        *   **Prompt Engineering:**  Create a prompt that instructs BERT to answer the query based on the provided context. For example:  `\"Answer the following question based on the context provided. Question: {query} Context: {retrieved_text}\"`.  Good prompt engineering is *crucial* for RAG performance.\n",
       "*   **Generation:**\n",
       "    *   **Pass to BERT:** Feed the combined (query + context) input to a BERT model.  Crucially, you need to use a *generative* BERT model (or a model fine-tuned for text generation) to produce the chatbot's response. Options include:\n",
       "        *   **BERT2BERT:** An encoder-decoder model where both the encoder and decoder are based on BERT.\n",
       "        *   **BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer):**  Good for sequence-to-sequence tasks like text generation.\n",

       "\n",
       "Several frameworks can simplify the development process:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **LangChain:**  A powerful framework specifically designed for building applications with language models. It provides modules for data loading, text splitting, vector store integration, prompt engineering, and language model orchestration.  Highly recommended.\n",
       "*   **LlamaIndex:** Another framework like Langchain for integrating your data with LLMs.\n",
       "*   **Transformers (Hugging Face):** Essential for working with BERT and other transformer models. Provides pre-trained models, tokenizers, and utilities for fine-tuning.\n",
       "*   **Haystack:** An open-source framework for building search systems, including question answering systems.\n",
       "*   **Sentence Transformers:** A library specifically designed for generating high-quality sentence embeddings.\n",
       "\n",
       "**4. Code Example (Conceptual - using LangChain)**\n",
       "\n",
       "```python\n",
       "from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings\n",
       "from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS\n",
       "from langchain.llms import HuggingFaceHub  # Or OpenAI, etc.\n",
       "from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA\n",
       "from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader\n",
       "\n",
       "# 1. Load and prepare your data\n",
       "loader = TextLoader(\"my_knowledge_base.txt\") # Replace with your data loading\n",
       "documents = loader.load()\n",
       "\n",
       "# 2. Create embeddings\n",
       "embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name=\"all-mpnet-base-v2\") # Choose a good sentence embedding model\n",
       "\n",
       "# 3. Create a vector store\n",
       "db = FAISS.from_documents(documents, embeddings)\n",
       "\n",
       "# 4. Initialize the language model (Choose a generative model)\n",
       "llm = HuggingFaceHub(repo_id=\"google/flan-t5-xxl\", model_kwargs={\"temperature\":0.5, \"max_length\":512}) # Example with FLAN-T5\n",
       "\n",
       "# 5. Create a RetrievalQA chain (RAG)\n",
       "qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=llm, chain_type=\"stuff\", retriever=db.as_retriever(search_kwargs={\"k\": 3})) # 'stuff' is a simple chain type\n",
       "\n",
       "# 6. Chatbot loop\n",
       "while True:\n",
       "    query = input(\"Ask me anything: \")\n",
       "    if query.lower() == \"exit\":\n",
       "        break\n",
       "    result = qa({\"query\": query})\n",
       "    print(result[\"result\"])\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "**Explanation of the code:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Data Loading:**  Loads your knowledge base (replace `\"my_knowledge_base.txt\"` with your actual data).\n",
       "*   **Embeddings:**  Creates sentence embeddings using `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`.\n",
       "*   **Vector Store:**  Indexes the embeddings in a FAISS vector store.\n",
       "*   **Language Model:**  Initializes a language model (in this case, FLAN-T5 hosted on Hugging Face Hub).  You'll need an API key for Hugging Face Hub.  You can also use OpenAI, but that requires a paid OpenAI API key.\n",
       "*   **RetrievalQA Chain:**  Creates a `RetrievalQA` chain that combines retrieval (from the vector store) and generation (with the language model). The `chain_type=\"stuff\"` argument specifies a simple way of combining the retrieved documents into the prompt.  `search_kwargs={\"k\": 3}` specifies the number of documents to retrieve.\n",
       "*   **Chatbot Loop:**  Gets user input, runs the query through the `RetrievalQA` chain, and prints the result.\n",
       "\n",
       "**5. Key Considerations and Challenges**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Computational Resources:** Training and running large BERT models can be computationally expensive. Consider using a GPU or cloud-based resources.\n",
       "*   **Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tuning the BERT model on your specific dataset can significantly improve performance, but requires a substantial amount of labeled data.\n",
       "*   **Context Length:**  BERT has a limited context length (e.g., 512 tokens).  Carefully consider how you split your documents and create your prompts to stay within this limit.  Longer context models exist, like Longformer or even newer models that extend beyond typical BERT models.\n",
       "*   **Hallucinations:**  Language models can sometimes generate incorrect or nonsensical answers (hallucinations). RAG can help reduce this by providing the model with grounded context.\n",
       "*   **Prompt Engineering:** Designing effective prompts is crucial for getting good results with RAG. Experiment with different prompts to find what works best for your task.\n",
       "*   **Scalability:**  For production deployments, you'll need to consider scalability.  Vector databases like Pinecone and Weaviate are designed to handle large datasets and high query volumes.\n",
       "*   **Evaluation:**  Thoroughly evaluate your chatbot's performance to identify areas for improvement.  Metrics like accuracy, relevance, and fluency are important.\n",
       "*   **Cost:**  Consider the cost of using cloud-based services like OpenAI, Pinecone, or Hugging Face Hub.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In summary, building a BERT-powered chatbot with RAG involves data preparation, embedding generation, vector database indexing, chatbot implementation, and careful consideration of performance and scalability. Using frameworks like LangChain and Hugging Face Transformers can greatly simplify the development process.** Good luck!\n"

      "\n",
      "It started with a robin. Not just any robin, mind you, but a particularly audacious one, perched just outside Eleanor's open window, flaunting a glistening earthworm. Clementine, roused from her nap by the worm's wriggling, felt a primal urge ignite within her. She had to have it.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a leap and a scramble, she was out the window, landing with a less-than-graceful thump on the flower-laden balcony. The robin, startled, fluttered to a nearby oak tree. Clementine, undeterred, followed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was new territory. The familiar scent of Eleanor's garden faded as she cautiously navigated the rough bark of the oak. The robin, leading her on, hopped from branch to branch, deeper and deeper into the unknown wilderness of Eleanor's sprawling backyard.\n",
      "\n",
      "The backyard was a jungle to a pampered housecat. Towering sunflowers became looming giants. The babbling brook, usually a distant murmur, was now a rushing river she had to carefully leap across. She dodged buzzing bees the size of her head (or so they seemed), and navigated through a maze of fragrant lavender bushes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly, the robin took flight, disappearing into a thicket of tangled blackberry bushes. Clementine, frustrated, peered into the thorny depths. This was a challenge. The worm, however, remained a compelling prize.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ignoring the sharp pricks against her fur, she bravely plunged in. The blackberries scratched and pulled, the air thick with the sweet, tart scent of ripened fruit. She squeezed and wriggled, determined to reach the other side.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, she saw it. Not the robin, but something far more intriguing. A tiny, hidden glade, bathed in dappled sunlight. In the center stood a miniature toadstool circle, shimmering with an ethereal glow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clementine, forgetting all about the robin and its worm, approached the circle cautiously. As she stepped inside, a strange tingling sensation washed over her. The air hummed with an invisible energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "She didn't understand what it was, but she knew it was magical. It felt like sunshine on her fur, like Eleanor's gentle touch, but amplified, imbued with a sense of wonder. She sat in the center of the circle, soaking it in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the tingling subsided. Clementine stretched, feeling strangely refreshed and invigorated. She had no worm, but she had found something far more valuable: a secret, a magical place hidden in her own backyard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Making her way back through the blackberry bushes, she realized she wasn't afraid anymore. The buzzing bees, the rushing brook, the towering sunflowers – they no longer seemed so daunting. She had faced them, conquered them, and discovered a hidden magic within herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she finally returned to Eleanor, covered in scratches and smelling of blackberries, Eleanor gasped. \"Clementine! Where have you been?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Clementine simply purred, rubbing against Eleanor's legs. She wouldn't tell her about the robin, or the worm, or the magical toadstool circle. Some adventures were best kept secret, tucked away in the heart, waiting to be relived in dreams.\n",
      "\n",
      "And from then on, Clementine, the calico who wasn't built for adventure, found herself looking at the world with a new appreciation, a spark of curiosity twinkling in her emerald eyes. For she knew, now, that adventure could be found in the most unexpected of places, even in her own backyard. And all it took was a little bit of courage, a little bit of curiosity, and a very tempting earthworm.\n",

       "This file is a Bash script designed to enhance your command-line prompt with Git repository status information. In a nutshell, it modifies your prompt to display details about the Git repository you're currently working in, such as the branch name, whether there are uncommitted changes, and the status of your remote connection.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's a breakdown of what it does and why you'd use it:\n",
       "\n",
       "**What it does:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Displays Git Status:** The primary function is to show information about your Git repository directly in your command prompt. This includes things like:\n",
       "    *   The current branch name\n",
       "    *   Whether there are staged or unstaged changes\n",
       "    *   Whether your local branch is ahead or behind the remote branch\n",
       "    *   The number of commits ahead/behind\n",
       "    *   The presence of untracked files\n",
       "    *   The status of submodules\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Customizable:** It's designed to be configurable through environment variables and theme files. You can customize the colors, symbols, and the specific information displayed in the prompt. It allows creation of custom themes, that use colors.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Asynchronous Operations:** It attempts to fetch remote Git status asynchronously to avoid blocking your prompt while waiting for network operations. This way, prompt loading won't be blocked by network latency.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Virtual Environment Support:** Includes integration for displaying virtual environment information (Python virtualenv, Node.js, conda) in the prompt.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Why you'd use it:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Increased Awareness:** It gives you immediate, visual feedback about the state of your Git repository, making it easier to track changes and manage your workflow. You don't have to type `git status` repeatedly.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Improved Productivity:** By having Git information readily available in the prompt, you can make quicker decisions and avoid common mistakes, such as committing to the wrong branch or forgetting to stage changes.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Customization:** You can tailor the prompt to show exactly the information you care about, and in a way that fits your personal preferences.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Efficiency:** It reduces the need to constantly run `git status` commands, saving you time and keystrokes.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, this script is a tool to make working with Git from the command line more efficient and informative by integrating Git status directly into your shell prompt. If you work with Git a lot in the terminal, it can be a valuable addition to your setup.\n"
